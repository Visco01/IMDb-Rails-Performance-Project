Steps to run load tests:

1) Install Jmeter

2) Add "jmeter" to environment variables in your OS aiming to your jmeter installation executable to create an alias.

For example, in MacOS (.zshrc or .bashrc): alias jmeter="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/jmeter/5.6.3/bin/jmeter"

3) If the previous step is done, go to the terminal and run the command "jmeter" to open the editor.

Open both Jmeter tests (standalone and mixed folders), go to the component "User Defined Variables" and change the value of "test_path" variable according to the tests full-path location inside your OS.

Standalone tests example: /Users/visco/Documents/code/performance-project/jmeter/standalone-load-tests/
Mixed tests example: /Users/visco/Documents/code/performance-project/jmeter/mixed-load-tests/

4) Make sure you are logged into the ZeroTier network

5) Run the shell script "run_jmeter_tests.sh" (it will take a while according to the tests duration)

6) The result reports will be written inside these folders:

./standalone-load-tests/report/
./mixed-load-tests/report/
